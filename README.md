# LoanCalculator

This is a webpage I created using d3.js that allows the user to manipulate the interest rate, monthly payment amount, and principal of a loan. Once these values are submitted, an interactive line plot is generated. Note that hovering over a circle will display a breakdown of the loan at that timepoint.
